# Personal Site 
My personal site is a website for previewing my career, academic, and learning experience to establish my credibility in a way that fully expresses myself. THe personal site is a way for otehrs to reach out to me for networking and friendship building opportunities.

![Personal Site (V1 1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84485729/190547244-53d17363-f80a-411d-b98d-94645fcc1bc4.gif)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, SCSS, CSS, HTML
With JQuery, the JavaScript enables users to fill out a form with their name, e-mail address, and message to send to me. There are two buttons as well that can be clicked. The downward facing arrow allows for the page to move from the top to the bottom of the page. When a piece of media is clicked with the cursor, the media enlarges to better view it.

## Optimizations

Version 1.0 had its files in an incorrect and disorganized fashion that made it challenging for website hosting platforms, such as Netlify and Heroku to catch onto my files. Version 1.1 has a green color scheme with more details about me, such as my skill set. In the future, I see myself adding an option bar and further create a website that suits my needs in terms of personality and in-depthness.

## Lessons Learned:

I am learning how to use the terminal more in terms of pushing different commands when testing my project. I've learned how to edit items quickly in Visual Studio Code. I am learnined how, across multiple lanaguages, where they all abstractly connect with one another.
